This means you don't have to completely block out the background.\n",
    "\n",

    "CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12\n",
    "CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:\n",
    "\n",
    "p {\n",
    "  position: relative;\n",
    "  bottom: 10px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position. Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13\n",
    "The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15\n",
    "Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. One way to do this is to set its margin to a value of auto.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you set the display property to block.\n",
    "\n",

    "The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they \"cancel\" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)\n",
    "green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)\n",
    "blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)\n",
    "This is different than the outdated RYB color model that many of us were taught in school, which has different primary and complementary colors. Modern color theory uses the additive RGB model (like on a computer screen) and the subtractive CMY(K) model (like in printing). Read here for more information on this complex subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many color picking tools available online that have an option to find the complement of a color.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17\n",
    "Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "Color\tHex Code\n",

    "Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the hsl() property as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of using hsl() with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Color\tHSL\n",
    "red\thsl(0, 100%, 50%)\n",
    "yellow\thsl(60, 100%, 50%)\n",
    "green\thsl(120, 100%, 50%)\n",
    "cyan\thsl(180, 100%, 50%)\n",
    "blue\thsl(240, 100%, 50%)\n",
    "magenta\thsl(300, 100%, 50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19\n",
    "The hsl() option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the tone of a color. Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint of that color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting and shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of hsl() stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation percent changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is useful when you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20\n",
    "Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. Here is the general syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a vertical gradient and 45deg is angled like a backslash. The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));\n",
    "\n",
    "## 21\n",
    "The repeating-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the major difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern. repeating-linear-gradient() accepts a variety of values, but for simplicity, you'll work with an angle value and color stop values in this challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The angle value is the direction of the gradient. Color stops are like width values that mark where a transition takes place, and are given with a percentage or a number of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "n the example demonstrated in the code editor, the gradient starts with the color yellow at 0 pixels which blends into the second color blue at 40 pixels away from the start. Since the next color stop is also at 40 pixels, the gradient immediately changes to the third color green, which itself blends into the fourth color value red as that is 80 pixels away from the beginning of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, it helps to think about the color stops as pairs where every two colors blend together.\n",
    "\n",
    "0px [yellow -- blend -- blue] 40px [green -- blend -- red] 80px\n",
    "\n",
    "If every two color stop values are the same color, the blending isn't noticeable because it's between the same color, followed by a hard transition to the next color, so you end up with stripes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 22\n",
    "To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function. The following code example doubles the size of all the paragraph elements on the page:\n",
    "\n",
    "p {\n",
    "  transform: scale(2);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23\n",
    "The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:\n",
    "\n",
    "p:hover {\n",
    "  transform: scale(2.1);\n",
    "}\n",
    "Note: Applying a transform to a div element will also affect any child elements contained in the div.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 24\n",
    "The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "p {\n",
    "  transform: skewX(-32deg);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "## 25\n",
    "Given that the skewX() function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, it is no surprise that the skewY() property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 26\n",
    "One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and in this challenge you'll create one using pure CSS. But first, you need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. These pseudo-elements are used to add something before or after a selected element. In the following example, a ::before pseudo-element is used to add a rectangle to an element with the class heart:\n",
    "\n",
    ".heart::before {\n",
    "  content: \"\";\n",
    "  background-color: yellow;\n",

    "  width: 70px;\n",
    "  top: -50px;\n",
    "  left: 5px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "For the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined content property. This property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty string. In the above example, the element with the class of heart has a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border radius and is positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.\n",

    "To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation. There are eight animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important ones first:\n",
    "\n",
    "animation-name sets the name of the animation, which is later used by @keyframes to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "animation-duration sets the length of time for the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "@keyframes is how to specify exactly what happens within the animation over the duration. This is done by giving CSS properties for specific \"frames\" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If you compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS applies the magic to transition the element over the given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of @keyframes and the animation properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "#anim {\n",
    "  animation-name: colorful;\n",
    "  animation-duration: 3s;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",

    "  100% {\n",
    "    background-color: yellow;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "For the element with the anim id, the code snippet above sets the animation-name to colorful and sets the animation-duration to 3 seconds. Then the @keyframes rule links to the animation properties with the name colorful. It sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28\n",
    "That's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, causing the button to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards. The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished. You can set it like so:\n",

    "animation-fill-mode: forwards;\n",
    "\n",
    "## 29\n",
    "When elements have a specified position, such as fixed or relative, the CSS offset properties right, left, top, and bottom can be used in animation rules to create movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the example below, you can push the item downwards then upwards by setting the top property of the 50% keyframe to 50px, but having it set to 0px for the first (0%) and the last (100%) keyframe.\n",

    "In CSS animations, the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is ease, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end. Other options include ease-out, which is quick in the beginning then slows down, ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end, or linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 33\n",
    "The last challenge introduced the animation-timing-function property and a few keywords that change the speed of an animation over its duration. CSS offers an option other than keywords that provides even finer control over how the animation plays out, through the use of Bezier curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CSS animations, Bezier curves are used with the cubic-bezier function. The shape of the curve represents how the animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cubic-bezier function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: p0, p1, p2, and p3. p0 and p3 are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x and y values of the p1 and p2 \"anchor\" points in the form: (x1, y1, x2, y2). Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:\n",
    "\n",
    "animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1). This animation is a linear change of an element during the length of an animation, and is the same as using the linear keyword. In other words, it changes at a constant speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 34\n",
    "A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds up first and then slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between the ease-out keyword (for the blue element) and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation progressions to the ease-out keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:\n",
    "\n",
    "animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.\n",

    "This challenge animates an element to replicate the movement of a ball being juggled. Prior challenges covered the linear and ease-out cubic Bezier curves, however neither depicts the juggling movement accurately. You need to customize a Bezier curve for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the animation-iteration-count is set to infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two identical animation progressions at the upward and downward movement of the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:\n",
    "\n",
    "cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped on a 1 by 1 coordinate system, and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can be set to numbers larger than one. This results in a bouncing movement that is ideal for simulating the juggling ball.\n"
