    "HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble div. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning in your markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page. It's not meant to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to quickly navigate to the main content. If you've ever seen a \"Jump to Main Content\" link at the top of a page, using a main tag automatically gives assistive devices that functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2\n",
    "article is another one of the new HTML5 elements that adds semantic meaning to your markup. article is a sectioning element, and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content. The tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining whether content can stand alone is usually a judgement call, but there are a couple simple tests you can use. Ask yourself if you removed all surrounding context, would that content still make sense? Similarly for text, would the content hold up if it were in an RSS feed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that folks using assistive technologies rely on organized, semantically meaningful markup to better understand your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note about section and div\n",
    "The section element is also new with HTML5, and has a slightly different semantic meaning than article. An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article, then each chapter is a section. When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<div> - groups content\n",
    "<section> - groups related content\n",
    "<article> - groups independent, self-contained content\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    " ## 3\n",
    " Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names as well as attributes. The next several challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The label tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The for attribute on a label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control and is used by screen readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned about radio buttons and their labels in a lesson in the Basic HTML section. In that lesson, we wrapped the radio button input element inside a label element along with the label text in order to make the text clickable. Another way to achieve this is by using the for attribute as explained in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the for attribute must be the same as the value of the id attribute of the form control. Here's an example:\n",
    "```css\n",
    "<form>\n",
    "  <label for=\"name\">Name:</label>\n",
    "  <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\">\n",
    "</form>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4\n",
    "The next form topic covers accessibility of radio buttons. Each choice is given a label with a for attribute tying to the id of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It often uses a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping, which is read by screen readers for each choice in the fieldset element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fieldset wrapper and legend tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender selection. Using a label with the for attribute for each radio button is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<form>\n",
    "  <fieldset>\n",
    "    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>\n",
    "    <input id=\"one\" type=\"radio\" name=\"items\" value=\"one\">\n",
    "    <label for=\"one\">Choice One</label><br>\n",
    "    <input id=\"two\" type=\"radio\" name=\"items\" value=\"two\">\n",
    "    <label for=\"two\">Choice Two</label><br>\n",
    "    <input id=\"three\" type=\"radio\" name=\"items\" value=\"three\">\n",
    "    <label for=\"three\">Choice Three</label>\n",
    "  </fieldset>\n",
    "</form>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5\n",
    "Forms often include the input field, which can be used to create several different form controls. The type attribute on this element indicates what kind of input will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed the text and submit input types in prior challenges, and HTML5 introduced an option to specify a date field. Depending on browser support, a date picker shows up in the input field when it's in focus, which makes filling in a form easier for all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For older browsers, the type will default to text, so it helps to show users the expected date format in the label or as placeholder text just in case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<label for=\"input1\">Enter a date:</label>\n",
    "<input type=\"date\" id=\"input1\" name=\"input1\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6\n",
    "Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also introduced the time element along with a datetime attribute to standardize times. This is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. A valid format of that date is held by the datetime attribute. This is the value accessed by assistive devices. It helps avoid confusion by stating a standardized version of a time, even if it's written in an informal or colloquial manner in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p>Master Camper Cat officiated the cage match between Goro and Scorpion <time datetime=\"2013-02-13\">last Wednesday</time>, which ended in a draw.</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7\n",
    "Have you noticed that all of the applied accessibility challenges so far haven't used any CSS? This is to show the importance of a logical document outline, and using semantically meaningful tags around your content before introducing the visual design aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, CSS's magic can also improve accessibility on your page when you want to visually hide content meant only for screen readers. This happens when information is in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position the screen reader-only elements off the visual area of the browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of the CSS rules that accomplish this:\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".sr-only {\n",
    "  position: absolute;\n",
    "  left: -10000px;\n",
    "  width: 1px;\n",
    "  height: 1px;\n",
    "  top: auto;\n",
    "  overflow: hidden;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: The following CSS approaches will NOT do the same thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "display: none; or visibility: hidden; hides content for everyone, including screen reader users\n",
    "Zero values for pixel sizes, such as width: 0px; height: 0px; removes that element from the flow of your document, meaning screen readers will ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8\n",
    "Low contrast between the foreground and background colors can make text difficult to read. Sufficient contrast improves the readability of your content, but what exactly does \"sufficient\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the strongest contrast. There are many contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9\n",
    "Color is a large part of visual design, but its use introduces two accessibility issues. First, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it. Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous challenges covered having text alternatives to address the first issue. The last challenge introduced contrast checking tools to help with the second. The WCAG-recommended contrast ratio of 4.5:1 applies for color use as well as gray-scale combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colorblind users have trouble distinguishing some colors from others - usually in hue but sometimes lightness as well. You may recall the contrast ratio is calculated using the relative luminance (or lightness) values of the foreground and background colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the 4.5:1 contrast ratio can be reached by shading (adding black to) the darker color and tinting (adding white to) the lighter color. Darker shades on the color wheel are considered to be shades of blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter tinted colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and blue-greens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10\n",
    "There are various forms of colorblindness. These can range from a reduced sensitivity to a certain wavelength of light to the inability to see color at all. The most common form is a reduced sensitivity to detect greens.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if two similar green colors are the foreground and background color of your content, a colorblind user may not be able to distinguish them. Close colors can be thought of as neighbors on the color wheel, and those combinations should be avoided when conveying important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Some online color picking tools include visual simulations of how colors appear for different types of colorblindness. These are great resources in addition to online contrast checking calculators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11\n",
    "Screen reader users have different options for what type of content their device reads. This includes skipping to (or over) landmark elements, jumping to the main content, or getting a page summary from the headings. Another option is to only hear the links available on a page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or what's between the anchor (a) tags. Having a list of \"click here\" or \"read more\" links isn't helpful. Instead, you should use brief but descriptive text within the a tags to provide more meaning for these users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12\n",
    "HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. This can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<button accesskey=\"b\">Important Button</button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13\n",
    "The HTML tabindex attribute has three distinct functions relating to an element's keyboard focus. When it's on a tag, it indicates that element can be focused on. The value (an integer that's positive, negative, or zero) determines the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain elements, such as links and form controls, automatically receive keyboard focus when a user tabs through a page. It's in the same order as the elements come in the HTML source markup. This same functionality can be given to other elements, such as div, span, and p, by placing a tabindex=\"0\" attribute on them. Here's an example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div tabindex=\"0\">I need keyboard focus!</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A negative tabindex value (typically -1) indicates that an element is focusable, but is not reachable by the keyboard. This method is generally used to bring focus to content programmatically (like when a div used for a pop-up window is activated), and is beyond the scope of these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14\n",
    "The tabindex attribute also specifies the exact tab order of elements. This is achieved when the value of the attribute is set to a positive number of 1 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting a tabindex=\"1\" will bring keyboard focus to that element first. Then it cycles through the sequence of specified tabindex values (2, 3, etc.), before moving to default and tabindex=\"0\" items.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when the tab order is set this way, it overrides the default order (which uses the HTML source). This may confuse users who are expecting to start navigation from the top of the page. This technique may be necessary in some circumstances, but in terms of accessibility, take care before applying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div tabindex=\"1\">I get keyboard focus, and I get it first!</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div tabindex=\"2\">I get keyboard focus, and I get it second!</div>\n",
