    "## [Create a Controlled Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react/create-a-controlled-form)\n",
    "React Redux provides a small API with two key features: Provider and connect. Another challenge covers connect. The Provider is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps your React app. This wrapper then allows you to access the Redux store and dispatch functions throughout your component tree. Provider takes two props, the Redux store and the child components of your app. Defining the Provider for an App component might look like this:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "<Provider store={store}>\n",
    "  <App/>\n",
    "</Provider>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Map State to Props](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux/map-state-to-props)\n",
    "The Provider component allows you to provide state and dispatch to your React components, but you must specify exactly what state and actions you want. This way, you make sure that each component only has access to the state it needs. You accomplish this by creating two functions: mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps().\n",
    "\n",
    "In these functions, you declare what pieces of state you want to have access to and which action creators you need to be able to dispatch. Once these functions are in place, you'll see how to use the React Redux connect method to connect them to your components in another challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Behind the scenes, React Redux uses the store.subscribe() method to implement mapStateToProps().\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Map Dispatch to Props](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux/map-dispatch-to-props)\n",
    "The mapDispatchToProps() function is used to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store. It's similar in structure to the mapStateToProps() function you wrote in the last challenge. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component props. However, instead of returning a piece of state, each property returns a function that calls dispatch with an action creator and any relevant action data. You have access to this dispatch because it's passed in to mapDispatchToProps() as a parameter when you define the function, just like you passed state to mapStateToProps(). Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's store.dispatch() to conduct these dispatches with mapDispatchToProps(). This is similar to how it uses store.subscribe() for components that are mapped to state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you have a loginUser() action creator that takes a username as an action payload. The object returned from mapDispatchToProps() for this action creator would look something like:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "{\n",
    "  submitLoginUser: function(username) {\n",
    "    dispatch(loginUser(username));\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Connect Redux to React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux/connect-redux-to-react)\n",
    "Now that you've written both the mapStateToProps() and the mapDispatchToProps() functions, you can use them to map state and dispatch to the props of one of your React components. The connect method from React Redux can handle this task. This method takes two optional arguments, mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps(). They are optional because you may have a component that only needs access to state but doesn't need to dispatch any actions, or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this method, pass in the functions as arguments, and immediately call the result with your component. This syntax is a little unusual and looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you want to omit one of the arguments to the connect method, you pass null in its place.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const addMessage = (message) => {\n",
    "  return {\n",
    "    type: 'ADD',\n",
    "    message: message\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n",
    "  return {\n",
    "    messages: state\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n",
    "  return {\n",
    "    submitNewMessage: (message) => {\n",
    "      dispatch(addMessage(message));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Presentational extends React.Component {\n",
    "  constructor(props) {\n",
    "    super(props);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  render() {\n",
    "    return <h3>This is a Presentational Component</h3>\n",
    "  }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "const connect = ReactRedux.connect;\n",
    "// change code below this line\n",
    "const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational)\n",
    "\n",
    "```"
