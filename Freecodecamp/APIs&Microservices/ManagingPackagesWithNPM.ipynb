    "## Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning\n",
    "Versions of the npm packages in the dependencies section of your package.json file follow what’s called Semantic Versioning (SemVer), an industry standard for software versioning aiming to make it easier to manage dependencies. Libraries, frameworks or other tools published on npm should use SemVer in order to clearly communicate what kind of changes projects can expect if they update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing SemVer can be useful when you develop software that uses external dependencies (which you almost always do). One day, your understanding of these numbers will save you from accidentally introducing breaking changes to your project without understanding why things that worked yesterday suddenly don’t work today. This is how Semantic Versioning works according to the official website:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"package\": \"MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that won’t work with earlier versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use the Tilde-Character to Always Use the Latest Patch Version of a Dependency\n",
    "To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependency’s version with the tilde (~) character. Here's an example of how to allow updates to any 1.3.x version.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"package\": \"~1.3.8\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use the Caret-Character to Use the Latest Minor Version of a Dependency\n",
    "Similar to how the tilde we learned about in the last challenge allows npm to install the latest PATCH for a dependency, the caret (^) allows npm to install future updates as well. The difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your current version of moment should be \"~2.10.2\" which allows npm to install to the latest 2.10.x version. If you were to use the caret (^) as a version prefix instead, npm would be allowed to update to any 2.x.x version.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"package\": \"^1.3.8\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This would allow updates to any 1.x.x version of the package."
