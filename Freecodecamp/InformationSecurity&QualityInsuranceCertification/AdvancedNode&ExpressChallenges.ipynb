    "Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Challenges\n",
    "Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process. Up to this point you have not been able to create an app utilizing this key concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and easiest way to use authentication middleware for Node.js is Passport. It is easy to learn, light-weight, and extremely flexible allowing for many strategies, which we will talk about in later challenges. In addition to authentication we will also look at template engines which allow for use of Pug and web sockets which allow for real time communication between all your clients and your server. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up a Template Engine\n",
    "A template engine enables you to use static template files (such as those written in Pug) in your app. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values which can be supplied by your server, and transforms the template into a static HTML file that is then sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page and allows for displaying of variables on the page without needing to make an API call from the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up Pug for use in your project, you will need to add it as a dependency first in your package.json. \"pug\": \"^0.1.0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to tell Node/Express to use the templating engine you will have to tell your express app to set 'pug' as the 'view-engine'. app.set('view engine', 'pug')\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you should change your response to the request for the index route to res.render with the path to the view views/pug/index.pug.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>code</summary>\n",
    "app.set('view engine', 'pug');<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "app.route('/')<br />\n",
    "  .get((req, res) => {<br />\n",
    "    res.render(process.cwd() + '/views/pug/index.pug'); <br />\n",
    "  });\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use a Template Engine's Powers\n",
    "As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project on Glitch, or cloned from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the greatest features of using a template engine is being able to pass variables from the server to the template file before rendering it to HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Pug file, you're able to use a variable by referencing the variable name as #{variable_name} inline with other text on an element or by using an equal sign on the element without a space such as p=variable_name which assigns the variable's value to the p element's text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly recommend looking at the syntax and structure of Pug here on GitHub's README. Pug is all about using whitespace and tabs to show nested elements and cutting down on the amount of code needed to make a beautiful site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at our pug file 'index.pug' included in your project, we used the variables title and message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass those along from our server, you will need to add an object as a second argument to your res.render with the variables and their values. For example, pass this object along setting the variables for your index view: {title: 'Hello', message: 'Please login'}\n",
    "\n",
    "It should look like: \n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "res.render(process.cwd() + '/views/pug/index', {title: 'Hello', message: 'Please login'});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up Passport\n",
    "In addition to Passport, we will use Express-session to handle sessions. Using this middleware saves the session id as a cookie in the client and allows us to access the session data using that id on the server. This way we keep personal account information out of the cookie used by the client to verify to our server they are authenticated and just keep the key to access the data stored on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up Passport for use in your project, you will need to add it as a dependency first in your package.json. \"passport\": \"^0.3.2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, add Express-session as a dependency now as well. Express-session has a ton of advanced features you can use but for now we're just going to use the basics! \"express-session\": \"^1.15.0\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to set up the session settings now and initialize Passport. Be sure to first create the variables 'session' and 'passport' to require 'express-session' and 'passport' respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up your express app to use the session we'll define just a few basic options. Be sure to add 'SESSION_SECRET' to your .env file and give it a random value. This is used to compute the hash used to encrypt your cookie!\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app.use(session({\n",
    "  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,\n",
    "  resave: true,\n",
    "  saveUninitialized: true,\n",
    "}));\n",
    "```\n",
    "As well you can go ahead and tell your express app to use 'passport.initialize()' and 'passport.session()'. (For example, app.use(passport.initialize());) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Serialization of a User Object\n",
    "As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project on Glitch, or cloned from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serialization and deserialization are important concepts in regards to authentication. To serialize an object means to convert its contents into a small key essentially that can then be deserialized into the original object. This is what allows us to know whos communicated with the server without having to send the authentication data like username and password at each request for a new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set this up properly, we need to have a serialize function and a deserialize function. In passport we create these with passport.serializeUser( OURFUNCTION ) and passport.deserializeUser( OURFUNCTION )\n",
    "\n",
    "The serializeUser is called with 2 arguments, the full user object and a callback used by passport. Returned in the callback should be a unique key to identify that user- the easiest one to use being the users _id in the object as it should be unique as it generated by MongoDb. Similarly deserializeUser is called with that key and a callback function for passport as well, but this time we have to take that key and return the users full object to the callback. To make a query search for a Mongo _id you will have to create const ObjectID = require('mongodb').ObjectID;, and then to use it you call new ObjectID(THE_ID). Be sure to add MongoDB as a dependency. You can see this in the examples below:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {\n",
    "  done(null, user._id);\n",
    "});\n",
    "passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {\n",
    "  db.collection('users').findOne(\n",
    "    {_id: new ObjectID(id)},\n",
    "      (err, doc) => {\n",
    "        done(null, doc);\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  );\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "NOTE: This deserializeUser will throw an error until we set up the DB in the next step so comment out the whole block and just call done(null, null) in the function deserializeUser. Submit your page when you think you've got it right.\n",

    "To do this, add MongoDB as a dependency and require it in your server. (const mongo = require('mongodb').MongoClient;)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Authentication Strategies\n",
    "A strategy is a way of authenticating a user. You can use a strategy for allowing users to authenticate based on locally saved information (if you have them register first) or from a variety of providers such as Google or GitHub. For this project we will set up a local strategy. To see a list of the 100's of strategies, visit Passports site here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add passport-local as a dependency and add it to your server as follows: const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local');\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will have to tell passport to use an instantiated LocalStartegy object with a few settings defined. Make sure this as well as everything from this point on is encapsulated in the database connection since it relies on it!\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "passport.use(new LocalStrategy(\n",
    "  function(username, password, done) {\n",
    "    db.collection('users').findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) {\n",
    "      console.log('User '+ username +' attempted to log in.');\n",
    "      if (err) { return done(err); }\n",
    "      if (!user) { return done(null, false); }\n",
    "      if (password !== user.password) { return done(null, false); }\n",
    "      return done(null, user);\n",
    "    });\n",
    "  }\n",
    "));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use Passport Strategies\n",
    "In the index.pug file supplied there is actually a login form. It has previously been hidden because of the inline JavaScript if showLogin with the form indented after it. Before showLogin as a variable was never defined, it never rendered the code block containing the form. Go ahead and on the res.render for that page add a new variable to the object showLogin: true. When you refresh your page, you should then see the form! This form is set up to POST on /login so this is where we should set up to accept the POST and authenticate the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this challenge you should add the route /login to accept a POST request. To authenticate on this route you need to add a middleware to do so before then sending a response. This is done by just passing another argument with the middleware before your function(req,res) with your response! The middleware to use is passport.authenticate('local').\n",
    "\n",
    "passport.authenticate can also take some options as an argument such as: { failureRedirect: '/' } which is incredibly useful so be sure to add that in as well. As a response after using the middleware (which will only be called if the authentication middleware passes) should be to redirect the user to /profile and that route should render the view 'profile.pug'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the authentication was successful, the user object will be saved in req.user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at this point if you enter a username and password in the form, it should redirect to the home page / and in the console of your server should be 'User {USERNAME} attempted to log in.' since we currently cannot login a user who isn't registered.\n",
    "<details><summary>code</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    " app.route('/login').post(passport.authenticate('local', {failureRedirect: '/'}),(req, res) => { <br />\n",
    "      res.redirect('/profile')<br />\n",
    "    })<br />\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "app.route('/profile').get((req, res) => {<br />\n",
    "  res.render(process.cwd()+ '/views/pug/profile.pug');<br />\n",
    "})<br />\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create New Middleware\n",
    "As in, any user can just go to /profile whether they authenticated or not by typing in the url. We want to prevent this by checking if the user is authenticated first before rendering the profile page. This is the perfect example of when to create a middleware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge here is creating the middleware function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next), which will check if a user is authenticated by calling passports isAuthenticated on the request which in turn checks for req.user is to be defined. If it is then next() should be called, otherwise we can just respond to the request with a redirect to our homepage to login. An implementation of this middleware is:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {\n",
    "  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {\n",
    "    return next();\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  res.redirect('/');\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now add ensureAuthenticated as a middleware to the request for the profile page before the argument to the get request containing the function that renders the page.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app\n",
    " .route('/profile')\n",
    " .get(ensureAuthenticated, (req,res) => {\n",
    "    res.render(process.cwd() + '/views/pug/profile');\n",
    " });\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "## Logging a User Out\n",
    "Creating the logout logic is easy. The route should just unauthenticate the user and redirect to the home page instead of rendering any view.\n",
    "\n",
    "In passport, unauthenticating a user is as easy as just calling req.logout(); before redirecting.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app.route('/logout')\n",
    "  .get((req, res) => {\n",
    "    req.logout();\n",
    "    res.redirect('/');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "You may have noticed that we're not handling missing pages (404), the common way to handle this in Node is with the following middleware. Go ahead and add this in after all your other routes:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app.use((req, res, next) => {\n",
    "  res.status(404)\n",
    "    .type('text')\n",
    "    .send('Not Found');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Registration of New Users\n",
    "Now we need to allow a new user on our site to register an account. On the res.render for the home page add a new variable to the object passed along- showRegistration: true. When you refresh your page, you should then see the registration form that was already created in your index.pug file! This form is set up to POST on /register so this is where we should set up to accept the POST and create the user object in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of the registration route should be as follows: Register the new user > Authenticate the new user > Redirect to /profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of step 1, registering the new user, should be as follows: Query database with a findOne command > if user is returned then it exists and redirect back to home OR if user is undefined and no error occurs then 'insertOne' into the database with the username and password and as long as no errors occur then call next to go to step 2, authenticating the new user, which we've already written the logic for in our POST /login route.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app.route('/register')\n",
    "  .post((req, res, next) => {\n",
    "    db.collection('users').findOne({ username: req.body.username }, function(err, user) {\n",
    "      if (err) {\n",
    "        next(err);\n",
    "      } else if (user) {\n",
    "        res.redirect('/');\n",
    "      } else {\n",
    "        db.collection('users').insertOne({\n",
    "          username: req.body.username,\n",
    "          password: req.body.password\n",
    "        },\n",
    "          (err, doc) => {\n",
    "            if (err) {\n",
    "              res.redirect('/');\n",
    "            } else {\n",
    "              next(null, user);\n",
    "            }\n",
    "          }\n",
    "        )\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    })\n",
    "  },\n",
    "    passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/' }),\n",
    "    (req, res, next) => {\n",
    "      res.redirect('/profile');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Hashing Your Passwords\n",
    "Going back to the information security section you may remember that storing plaintext passwords is never okay. Now it is time to implement BCrypt to solve this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add BCrypt as a dependency and require it in your server. You will need to handle hashing in 2 key areas: where you handle registering/saving a new account and when you check to see that a password is correct on login.\n",
    "Currently on our registration route, you insert a user's password into the database like the following: password: req.body.password. An easy way to implement saving a hash instead is to add the following before your database logic var hash = bcrypt.hashSync(req.body.password, 12); and replacing the req.body.password in the database saving with just password: hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally on our authentication strategy we check for the following in our code before completing the process: if (password !== user.password) { return done(null, false); }. After making the previous changes, now user.password is a hash. Before making a change to the existing code, notice how the statement is checking if the password is NOT equal then return non-authenticated. With this in mind your code could look as follows to properly check the password entered against the hash: if (!bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) { return done(null, false); }\n",
    "\n",
    "That is all it takes to implement one of the most important security features when you have to store passwords! Submit your page when you think you've got it right.\n",

    "## Implementation of Social Authentication\n",
    "The basic path this kind of authentication will follow in your app is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User clicks a button or link sending them to our route to authenticate using a specific strategy (EG. GitHub)\n",
    "2. Your route calls passport.authenticate('github') which redirects them to GitHub.\n",
    "3. The page the user lands on, on GitHub, allows them to login if they aren't already. It then asks them to approve access to their profile from our app.\n",
    "4. The user is then returned to our app at a specific callback url with their profile if they are approved.\n",
    "5. They are now authenticated and your app should check if it is a returning profile, or save it in your database if it is not.\n",
