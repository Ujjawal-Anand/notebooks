    "### arrays, lists, and loops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Make lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Declare a list using listOf and print it out. This list cannot be changed.\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val school = listOf(\"mackerel\", \"trout\", \"halibut\")\n",
    "println(school)\n",
    "⇒ [mackerel, trout, halibut]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Declare a list that can be changed using mutableListOf. Remove an item.\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val myList = mutableListOf(\"tuna\", \"salmon\", \"shark\")\n",
    "myList.remove(\"shark\")\n",
    "⇒ res36: kotlin.Boolean = true\n",
    "```\n",
    "The remove() method returns true when it successfully removes the item passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 : Make List\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike lists in Kotlin, which have mutable and immutable versions, there is no mutable version of an Array. Once you create an array, the size is fixed. You can't add or remove elements, except by copying to a new arra\n",
    "\n",
    "Declare an array of strings using arrayOf. Use the java.util.Arrays.toString() array utility to print it out.\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val school = arrayOf(\"shark\", \"salmon\", \"minnow\")\n",
    "println(java.util.Arrays.toString(school))\n",
    "⇒ [shark, salmon, minnow]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An array declared with arrayOf doesn't have a type associated with the elements, so you can mix types, which is helpful. Declare an array with different types.\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val mix = arrayOf(\"fish\", 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also declare arrays with one type for all the elements. Declare an array of integers using intArrayOf(). There are corresponding builders, or instantiation functions, for arrays of other types.\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = intArrayOf(1,2,3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Combine two arrays with the + operator.\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = intArrayOf(1,2,3)\n",
    "val numbers3 = intArrayOf(4,5,6)\n",
    "val foo2 = numbers3 + numbers\n",
    "println(foo2[5])\n",
    "=> 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As in other languages, you can nest arrays and lists. That is, when you put an array within an array, you have an array of arrays—not a flattened array of the contents of the two. The elements of an array can also be lists, and the elements of lists can be arrays.\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val numbers = intArrayOf(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "val oceans = listOf(\"Atlantic\", \"Pacific\")\n",
    "val oddList = listOf(numbers, oceans, \"salmon\")\n",
    "println(oddList)\n",
    "⇒ [[I@89178b4, [Atlantic, Pacific], salmon]\n",
    "```\n",
    "   The first element, numbers, is an Array. When you don't use the array utility to print it, Kotlin prints the address instead of the contents of the array.\n",
    "   One nice feature of Kotlin is that you can initialize arrays with code instead of initializing them to 0. Try this example:\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val array = Array (5) { it * 2 }\n",
    "println(java.util.Arrays.toString(array))\n",
    "⇒ [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The initialization code is between the curly braces, {}. In the code, it refers to the array index, starting with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make Loops\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val school = arrayOf(\"shark\", \"salmon\", \"minnow\")\n",
    "for (element in school) {\n",
    "    print(element + \" \")\n",
    "}\n",
    "⇒ shark salmon minnow\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Kotlin, you can loop through the elements and the indexes at the same time. Try this example:\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "for ((index, element) in school.withIndex()) {\n",
    "    println(\"Item at $index is $element\\n\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "⇒ Item at 0 is shark\n",
    "Item at 1 is salmon\n",
    "Item at 2 is minnow\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " You can specify ranges of numbers or of characters, alphabetically. And as in other languages, you don't have to step forward by 1. You can step backward using downTo.\n",
    " ```kotlin\n",
    "for (i in 1..5) print(i)\n",
    "⇒ 12345\n",
    "\n",
    "for (i in 5 downTo 1) print(i)\n",
    "⇒ 54321\n",

    "for (i in 3..6 step 2) print(i)\n",
    "⇒ 35\n",
    "\n",
    "for (i in 'd'..'g') print (i)\n",
    "⇒ defg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other languages, Kotlin has while loops, do...while loops, and ++ and -- operators. Kotlin also has repeat loops.\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "var bubbles = 0\n",
    "while (bubbles < 50) {\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Lambdas\n",
    " A lambda is an expression that makes a function. But instead of declaring a named function, you declare a function that has no name. Part of what makes this useful is that the lambda expression can now be passed as data. In other languages, lambdas are called anonymous functions, function literals, or similar names.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Higher Order Function\n",
    "You can create a higher-order function by passing a lambda to another function. In the previous task, you created a higher-order function called filter. You passed the following lambda expression to filter as the condition to check:\n",
    "{it[0] == 'p'}\n",
