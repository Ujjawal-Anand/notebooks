    "## Working with form templates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form rendering option\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other output options though for the `<label`>/`<input`> pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* {{ form.as_table }} will render them as table cells wrapped in `<tr`> tags\n",
    "* {{ form.as_p }} will render them wrapped in `<p`> tags\n",
    "* {{ form.as_ul }} will render them wrapped in `<li`> tags  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you’ll have to provide the surrounding `<table`> or `<ul`> elements yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Outputting forms as html](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/forms/api/#ref-forms-api-outputting-html)for more eexample\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering Fields Manually:\n",
    "We don’t have to let Django unpack the form’s fields; we can do it manually if we like (allowing us to reorder the fields, for example). Each field is available as an attribute of the form using {{ form.name_of_field }}, and in a Django template, will be rendered appropriately. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` html\n",
    "{{ form.non_field_errors }}\n",
    "<div class=\"fieldWrapper\">\n",
    "    {{ form.subject.errors }}\n",
    "    <label for=\"{{ form.subject.id_for_label }}\">Email subject:</label>\n",
    "    {{ form.subject }}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"fieldWrapper\">\n",
    "    {{ form.message.errors }}\n",
    "    <label for=\"{{ form.message.id_for_label }}\">Your message:</label>\n",
    "    {{ form.message }}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"fieldWrapper\">\n",
    "    {{ form.sender.errors }}\n",
    "    <label for=\"{{ form.sender.id_for_label }}\">Your email address:</label>\n",
    "    {{ form.sender }}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"fieldWrapper\">\n",
    "    {{ form.cc_myself.errors }}\n",
    "    <label for=\"{{ form.cc_myself.id_for_label }}\">CC yourself?</label>\n",
    "    {{ form.cc_myself }}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering form's error message\n",
    "Using {{ form.name_of_field.errors }} displays a list of form errors, rendered as an unordered list. This might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<ul class=\"errorlist\">\n",
    "    <li>Sender is required.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The list has a CSS class of errorlist to allow you to style its appearance. If you wish to further customize the display of errors you can do so by looping over them:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{% if form.subject.errors %}\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "    {% for error in form.subject.errors %}\n",
    "        <li><strong>{{ error|escape }}</strong></li>\n",
    "    {% endfor %}\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "{% endif %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Non-field errors (and/or hidden field errors that are rendered at the top of the form when using helpers like form.as_p()) will be rendered with an additional class of nonfield to help distinguish them from field-specific errors. For example, {{ form.non_field_errors }} would look like:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<ul class=\"errorlist nonfield\">\n",
    "    <li>Generic validation error</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "See [The Forms API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/forms/api/) for more on errors, styling, and working with form attributes in templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping over form's fields\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re using the same HTML for each of your form fields, you can reduce duplicate code by looping through each field in turn using a {% for %} loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` html\n",
    "{% for field in form %}\n",
    "    <div class=\"fieldWrapper\">\n",
    "        {{ field.errors }}\n",
    "        {{ field.label_tag }} {{ field }}\n",
    "        {% if field.help_text %}\n",
    "        <p class=\"help\">{{ field.help_text|safe }}</p>\n",
    "        {% endif %}\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "{% endfor %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Field Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important Fied arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "### required\n",
    "By default, each Field class assumes the value is required, so if you pass an empty value – either None or the empty string (\"\") – then clean() will raise a ValidationError exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify that a field is not required, pass required=False to the Field constructor:\n",
    "``` Python\n",
    "> f = forms.CharField(required=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### label\n",
    "The label argument lets you specify the “human-friendly” label for this field. This is used when the Field is displayed in a Form.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">> from django import forms\n",
    ">> class CommentForm(forms.Form):\n",
    "    name = forms.CharField(label='Your Name')\n",
    "    url = forms.URLField(label='Your Website', required=False)\n",
    "    comment = forms.CharField()\n",
    ">> f = CommentForm(auto_id=False)\n",
    ">> print(f)\n",
    "<tr><th>Your name:</th><td><input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" required></td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><th>Your website:</th><td><input type=\"url\" name=\"url\"></td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><th>Comment:</th><td><input type=\"text\" name=\"comment\" required></td></tr>\n",
    " \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### initial\n",
    "The use-case for this is when you want to display an “empty” form in which a field is initialized to a particular value. For example:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">> from django import forms\n",
    ">> class CommentForm(form.Form):\n",
    "    name = forms.CharField(initial='Your Name')\n",
    "    url = forms.UrlField(initial='http://')\n",
    "    comment = forms.CharField()\n",
    "\n",
    ">> f = CommentForm(auto_id='id_for_%s')\n",
    ">> print(f)\n",
    "<tr><th>Name:</th><td><input type=\"text\" for='id_for_name' name=\"name\" value=\"Your name\" required></td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><th>Url:</th><td><input type=\"url\" for='id_for_url' name=\"url\" value=\"http://\" required></td></tr>\n",
    "<tr><th>Comment:</th><td><input type=\"text\" for='id_for_comment' name=\"comment\" required></td></tr>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be thinking, why not just pass a dictionary of the initial values as data when displaying the form? Well, if you do that, you’ll trigger validation, and the HTML output will include any validation errors:\n",
    "see [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/forms/fields/#django.forms.Field.initial)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that initial values are not used as “fallback” data in validation if a particular field’s value is not given. initial values are only intended for initial form display.\n",
    "\n",
    "### help_text\n",
    "The help_text argument lets you specify descriptive text for this Field. If you provide help_text, it will be displayed next to the Field when the Field is rendered by one of the convenience Form methods (e.g., as_ul()).\n",
    "\n",
    "### error_messages\n",
    "The error_messages argument lets you override the default messages that the field will raise. Pass in a dictionary with keys matching the error messages you want to override. For example, here is the default error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> name = forms.CharField(error_messages={'required': 'Please enter your name'})\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### validators\n",
    "The validators argument lets you provide a list of validation functions for this field.\n",
    "For more infor go [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/validators/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### localize\n",
    "The localize argument enables the localization of form data input, as well as the rendered output.\n",
    "See the [format localization](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/i18n/formatting/) for more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### disabled\n",
    "The disabled boolean argument, when set to True, disables a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won’t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field’s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form’s initial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Widgets\n",
    "[see](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/forms/widgets/#built-in-widgets)\n",
    "\n",
    "A widget is Django’s representation of an HTML input element. The widget handles the rendering of the HTML, and the extraction of data from a GET/POST dictionary that corresponds to the widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django import forms\n",
    "\n",
    "BIRTH_YEAR_CHOICES = ('1980', '1981', '1982')\n",
    "FAVORITE_COLORS_CHOICES = (\n",
    "    ('blue', 'Blue'),\n",
    "    ('green', 'Green'),\n",
    "    ('black', 'Black'),\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "class SimpleForm(forms.Form):\n",
    "    birth_year = forms.DateField(widget=forms.SelectDateWidget(years=BIRTH_YEAR_CHOICES))\n",
    "    favorite_colors = forms.MultipleChoiceField(\n",
    "        required=False,\n",
    "        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple,\n",
    "        choices=FAVORITE_COLORS_CHOICES,\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "See the [Built-in widgets](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/forms/widgets/#built-in-widgets) for more information about which widgets are available and which arguments they accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Widgets inheriting from the Select widget\n",
    "\n",
    "Widgets inheriting from the Select widget deal with choices. They present the user with a list of options to choose from. The different widgets present this choice differently; the Select widget itself uses a `<select`> HTML list representation, while RadioSelect uses radio buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select widgets are used by default on ChoiceField fields. The choices displayed on the widget are inherited from the ChoiceField and changing ChoiceField.choices will update Select.choices. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from django import forms\n",
    ">>> CHOICES = (('1', 'First',), ('2', 'Second',))\n",
    ">>> choice_field = forms.ChoiceField(widget=forms.RadioSelect, choices=CHOICES)\n",
    ">>> choice_field.choices\n",
    "[('1', 'First'), ('2', 'Second')]\n",
    ">>> choice_field.widget.choices\n",
    "[('1', 'First'), ('2', 'Second')]\n",
    ">>> choice_field.widget.choices = ()\n",
    ">>> choice_field.choices = (('1', 'First and only',),)\n",
    ">>> choice_field.widget.choices\n",
    "[('1', 'First and only')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Styling widget instances\n",
    "\n",
    "use the Widget.attrs argument when creating the widget to add some special css properties\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CommentForm(forms.Form):\n",
    "    name = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'class': 'special'}))\n",
    "    url = forms.URLField()\n",
    "    comment = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'size': '40'}))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also modify a widget in the form definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CommentForm(forms.Form):\n",
    "    name = forms.CharField()\n",
    "    url = forms.URLField()\n",
    "    comment = forms.CharField()\n",
    "\n",
    "    name.widget.attrs.update({'class': 'special'})\n",
    "    comment.widget.attrs.update(size='40')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if the field isn’t declared directly on the form (such as model form fields), you can use the Form.fields attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CommentForm(forms.ModelForm):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n",

    "        model = Book\n",
    "        fields = ['name', 'authors']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With these models, the ModelForm subclasses above would be roughly equivalent to this (the only difference being the save() method, which we’ll discuss in a moment.):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from django import forms\n",
    "\n",
    "class AuthorForm(forms.Form):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The save() method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method creates and saves a database object from the data bound to the form. A subclass of ModelForm can accept an existing model instance as the keyword argument instance; if this is supplied, save() will update that instance. If it’s not supplied, save() will create a new instance of the specified model:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">> from myapp.models import Article\n",
    ">> from myapp.forms import ArticleForm\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a form instance from form post data\n",
    ">> f = ArticleForm(request.POST)\n",
    "\n",
    "# save a new_article form from form data\n",
    ">> new_article = f.save()\n",
    "\n",
    "# crrate a form to edit an existing article, but use\n",
    "# POST data to populate form\n",
    ">> a = Article.objects.get(pk=1)\n",
    ">> f = ArticleForm(request.POST, instance=a)\n",
    ">> f.save()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This save() method accepts an optional commit keyword argument, which accepts either True or False. If you call save() with commit=False, then it will return an object that hasn’t yet been saved to the database. In this case, it’s up to you to call save() on the resulting model instance. This is useful if you want to do custom processing on the object before saving it, or if you want to use one of the specialized model saving options. commit is True by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another side effect of using commit=False is seen when your model has a many-to-many relation with another model. If your model has a many-to-many relation and you specify commit=False when you save a form, Django cannot immediately save the form data for the many-to-many relation. This is because it isn’t possible to save many-to-many data for an instance until the instance exists in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work around this problem, every time you save a form using commit=False, Django adds a save_m2m() method to your ModelForm subclass. After you’ve manually saved the instance produced by the form, you can invoke save_m2m() to save the many-to-many form data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a form instance with POST data.\n",
    ">>> f = AuthorForm(request.POST)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create, but don't save the new author instance.\n",
    ">>> new_author = f.save(commit=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the author in some way.\n",
    ">>> new_author.some_field = 'some_value'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the new instance.\n",
    ">>> new_author.save()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, save the many-to-many data for the form.\n",
    ">>> f.save_m2m()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**   \n",
    "> Calling save_m2m() is only required if you use save(commit=False). When you use a simple save() on a form, all data – including many-to-many data – is saved without the need for any additional method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting Fields to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the fields attribute to the special value '__all__' to indicate that all fields in the model should be used.   \n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.forms import ModelForm\n",
    "\n",
    "class AuthorForm(ModelForm):\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        model = Author\n",
    "        fields = '__all__'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the exclude attribute of the ModelForm’s inner Meta class to a list of fields to be excluded from the form.  \n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PartialAuthorForm(ModelForm):\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        model = Author\n",
    "        exclude = ['title']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**  \n",
    "> Any fields not included in a form by the above logic will not be set by the form’s save() method. Also, if you manually add the excluded fields back to the form, they will not be initialized from the model instance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Django will prevent any attempt to save an incomplete model, so if the model does not allow the missing fields to be empty, and does not provide a default value for the missing fields, any attempt to save() a ModelForm with missing fields will fail. To avoid this failure, you must instantiate your model with initial values for the missing, but required fields:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ``` python\n",
    "    author = Author(title='Mr')\n",
    "    form = PartialAuthorForm(request.POST, instance=author)\n",
    "    form.save()\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> Alternatively, you can use save(commit=False) and manually set any extra required fields:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "    form = PartialAuthorForm(request.POST)\n",
    "    author = form.save(commit=False)\n",
    "    author.title = 'Mr'\n",
    "    author.save()\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overriding the default fields\n",
    "\n",
    "ModelForm gives you the flexibility of changing the form field for a given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want the CharField for the name attribute of Author to be represented by a `<textarea`> instead of its default `<input type=\"text\"`>, you can override the field’s widget:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from django.forms import ModelForm, Textarea\n",
    "from myapp.models import Author\n",
    "\n",
    "class AuthorForm(ModelForm):\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        model = Author\n",
    "        fields = ('name', 'title', 'birth_date')\n",
    "        widgets = {\n",
    "            'name': Textarea(attrs={'cols': 80, 'rows': 20}),\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you can specify the labels, help_texts and error_messages attributes of the inner Meta class if you want to further customize a field.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you wanted to customize the wording of all user facing strings for the name field:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n",
    "\n",
    "class AuthorForm(ModelForm):\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        model = Author\n",
    "        fields = ('name', 'title', 'birth_date')\n",
    "        labels = {\n",
    "            'name': _('Writer'),\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        help_texts = {\n",
    "            'name': _('Some useful help text.'),\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        error_messages = {\n",
    "            'name': {\n",
    "                'max_length': _(\"This writer's name is too long.\"),\n",
    "            },\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Providing initial values\n",
    "\n",
    "As with regular forms, it’s possible to specify initial data for forms by specifying an initial parameter when instantiating the form. Initial values provided this way will override both initial values from the form field and values from an attached model instance. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> article = Article.objects.get(pk=1)\n",
    ">>> article.headline\n",
    "'My headline'\n",
    ">>> form = ArticleForm(initial={'headline': 'Initial headline'}, instance=article)\n",
    ">>> form['headline'].value()\n",
    "'Initial headline'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ModelForm factory function\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create forms from a given model using the standalone function modelform_factory(), instead of using a class definition. This may be more convenient if you do not have many customizations to make:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> from django.forms import modelform_factory\n",
    ">>> from myapp.models import Book\n",
    ">>> BookForm = modelform_factory(Book, fields=(\"author\", \"title\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be used to make simple modifications to existing forms, for example by specifying the widgets to be used for a given field:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from django.forms import Textarea\n",
    ">>> Form = modelform_factory(Book, form=BookForm,\n",
    "...                          widgets={\"title\": Textarea()})\n",
    "```\n",
    "The fields to include can be specified using the fields and exclude keyword arguments, or the corresponding attributes on the ModelForm inner Meta class. Please see the ModelForm [Selecting the fields to use](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/forms/modelforms/#modelforms-selecting-fields) documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "… or enable localization for specific fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> Form = modelform_factory(Author, form=AuthorForm, localized_fields=(\"birth_date\",))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "You would then render the formsets as normal. It is important to point out that you need to pass prefix on both the POST and non-POST cases so that it is rendered and processed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Formsets\n",
    "[see](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/forms/modelforms/#model-formsets)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from django.forms import modelformset_factory\n",
    ">>> from myapp.models import Author\n",
    ">>> AuthorFormSet = modelformset_factory(Author, fields=('name', 'title'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using fields restricts the formset to use only the given fields. Alternatively, you can take an “opt-out” approach, specifying which fields to exclude:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> AuthorFormSet = modelformset_factory(Author, exclude=('birth_date',))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing the queryset\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when you create a formset from a model, the formset will use a queryset that includes all objects in the model (e.g., Author.objects.all()). You can override this behavior by using the queryset argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> formset = AuthorFormSet(queryset=Author.objects.filter(name__startswith='O'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can create a subclass that sets self.queryset in __init__:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.forms import BaseModelFormSet\n",
    "from myapp.models import Author\n",
    "\n",
    "class BaseAuthorFormSet(BaseModelFormSet):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        self.queryset = Author.objects.filter(name__startswith='O')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, pass your BaseAuthorFormSet class to the factory function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> AuthorFormSet = modelformset_factory(\n",
    "...     Author, fields=('name', 'title'), formset=BaseAuthorFormSet)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to return a formset that doesn’t include any pre-existing instances of the model, you can specify an empty QuerySet:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> AuthorFormSet(queryset=Author.objects.none())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing the form\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when you use modelformset_factory, a model form will be created using modelform_factory(). Often, it can be useful to specify a custom model form. For example, you can create a custom model form that has custom validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AuthorForm(forms.ModelForm):\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        model = Author\n",
    "        fields = ('name', 'title')\n",
    "\n",
    "    def clean_name(self):\n",
    "        # custom validation for the name field\n",
    "        ...\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "Then, pass your model form to the factory function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "AuthorFormSet = modelformset_factory(Author, form=AuthorForm)\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is not always necessary to define a custom model form. The modelformset_factory function has several arguments which are passed through to modelform_factory, which are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying widgets to use in the form with widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the widgets parameter, you can specify a dictionary of values to customize the ModelForm’s widget class for a particular field. This works the same way as the widgets dictionary on the inner Meta class of a ModelForm works:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> AuthorFormSet = modelformset_factory(\n",
    "...     Author, fields=('name', 'title'),\n",
    "...     widgets={'name': Textarea(attrs={'cols': 80, 'rows': 20})})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving objects in the formset\n",
    "\n",
    "As with a ModelForm, you can save the data as a model object. This is done with the formset’s save() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a formset instance with POST data.\n",
    ">>> formset = AuthorFormSet(request.POST)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming all is valid, save the data.\n",
    ">>> instances = formset.save()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The save() method returns the instances that have been saved to the database. If a given instance’s data didn’t change in the bound data, the instance won’t be saved to the database and won’t be included in the return value (instances, in the above example).\n",
    "\n",
    "When fields are missing from the form (for example because they have been excluded), these fields will not be set by the save() method. You can find more information about this restriction, which also holds for regular ModelForms, in Selecting the fields to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass commit=False to return the unsaved model instances:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# don't save to the database\n",
    ">>> instances = formset.save(commit=False)\n",
    ">>> for instance in instances:\n",
    "...     # do something with instance\n",
    "...     instance.save()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This gives you the ability to attach data to the instances before saving them to the database. If your formset contains a ManyToManyField, you’ll also need to call formset.save_m2m() to ensure the many-to-many relationships are saved properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a model formset in a view\n",
    "\n",
    "Model formsets are very similar to formsets. Let’s say we want to present a formset to edit Author model instances:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.forms import modelformset_factory\n",
    "from django.shortcuts import render\n",
    "from myapp.models import Author\n",
    "\n",
    "def manage_authors(request):\n",
    "    AuthorFormSet = modelformset_factory(Author, fields=('name', 'title'))\n",
    "    if request.method == 'POST':\n",
    "        formset = AuthorFormSet(request.POST, request.FILES)\n",
    "        if formset.is_valid():\n",
    "            formset.save()\n",
    "            # do something.\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        formset = AuthorFormSet()\n",
    "    return render(request, 'manage_authors.html', {'formset': formset})\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, the view logic of a model formset isn’t drastically different than that of a “normal” formset. The only difference is that we call formset.save() to save the data into the database."
