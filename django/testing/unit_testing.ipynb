    "## Writing tests\n",
    "Djangoâ€™s unit tests use a Python standard library module: unittest. This module defines tests using a class-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "form django.test import TestCase\n",
    "\n",
    "from .models import Animal\n",
    "\n",
    "class AnimalTypeTest(UnitTest):\n",
    "    def setup(self):\n",
    "        Animal.objects.create(name=\"lion\", sound=\"roar\")\n",
    "        Animal.objects.create(name=\"cat\", sound=\"meow\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def test_animal_can_speak(self):\n",
    "        lion = Animal.objects.get(name=\"lion\")\n",
    "        cat = Animal.objects.get(name=\"cat\")\n",
    "        lion.assertEqual(lion.speak(), 'Lion says \"roar\"')\n",
    "        cat.assertEqual(cat.speak(), 'Cat says \"meow\"')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Test\n",
    "```python\n",
    "$ ./manage.py test animals.tests\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run all the tests found within the 'animals' package\n",
    "$ ./manage.py test animals\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run just one test case\n",
    "$ ./manage.py test animals.tests.AnimalTestCase\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run just one test method\n",
    "$ ./manage.py test animals.tests.AnimalTestCase.test_animals_can_speak\n",

    "## Fixture\n",
    "fixture is a term that's used in django often, usually meant to reference when you are loading up a fixtures of static data into the database. When we talk about fixtures in terms of testing its kind of a similar concept, a fixture is setting up stage for a test and this might be some state in your database such as a piece of dummy data or mocking out a resource or something like that\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Test\n",
    "1. Unit Test : The first is unit tests. These are tests that test a single unit of executioner code so it might be a single funcion, it might be a single branch within a function, it might be a single statement that you're testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Integration Test: meanwhile, are larger tests that focus on user behavior and testing entire applications. Put another way, integration testing combines different pieces of code functionality to make sure they behave correctly.\n",

    "# Pytest\n",
    "First test\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func(x):\n",
    "    return x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_answer():\n",
    "    assert func(3) == 5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Use the raises helper to assert that some code raises an exception:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func():\n",
    "    raise SystemExit(1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "def test_mytest():\n",
    "    with pytest.raises(SystemExit):\n",
    "        func()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you develop multiple tests, you may want to group them into a class. pytest makes it easy to create a class containing more than one test:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TestClass:\n",
    "    def test_one(self):\n",
    "        x = 'hello'\n",
    "        assert 'h' in x\n",

    "    def test_two(self):\n",
    "        x = \"hello\"\n",
    "        assert hasattr('check', x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "pytest provides Builtin fixtures/function arguments to request arbitrary resources, like a unique temporary directory:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# content of test_tmpdir.py\n",
    "def test_needsfiles(tmpdir):\n",
    "    print(tmpdir)\n",
    "    assert 0\n",
