    "### String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.capitalize()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.casefold()\n",
    "Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for caseless matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to \"ss\". Since it is already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'ß'; casefold() converts it to \"ss\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.center(width[, fillchar])\n",
    "Return centered in a string of length width. Padding is done using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s).\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> str = \"Hello\"\n",
    ">>> str.center(10)\n",
    "'  Hello   '\n",
    ">>> str = \"12345\"\n",
    ">>> str.center(10, '0')\n",
    "'0012345000'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.count(sub[, start[, end]])\n",
    "Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range [start, end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.encode(encoding=\"utf-8\", errors=\"strict\")\n",
    "Return an encoded version of the string as a bytes object. Default encoding is 'utf-8'. errors may be given to set a different error handling scheme. The default for errors is 'strict', meaning that encoding errors raise a UnicodeError. Other possible values are 'ignore', 'replace', 'xmlcharrefreplace', 'backslashreplace' and any other name registered via codecs.register_error(),\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])\n",
    "Return True if the string ends with the specified suffix, otherwise return False. suffix can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for. With optional start, test beginning at that position. With optional end, stop comparing at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.find(sub[, start[, end]])\n",
    "Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the slice s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note* The find() method should be used only if you need to know the position of sub. To check if sub is a substring or not, use the in operator:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 'Py' in 'Python'\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",

    "'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.index(sub[, start[, end]])\n",
    "Like find(), but raise ValueError when the substring is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.isalnum()\n",
    "Return True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and there is at least one character, False otherwise. A character c is alphanumeric if one of the following returns True: c.isalpha(), c.isdecimal(), c.isdigit(), or c.isnumeric().\n",
    "\n",
    "#### str.isdecimal() str.isdigit()  str.isnumeric \n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> str1 = u\"362436\"    #decimal characters\n",
    ">>> str2 = u\"3\"         #unicode digit\n",
